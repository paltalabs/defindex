# Using GUI (Basic)

If you want to create a vault using the strategies available in DeFindex without writing any code, you can use the DeFindex user interface. Here's how:

1. **Visit the DeFindex page**: Go to [app.defindex.io](https://app.defindex.io) and navigate to the vault creation section in the DeFindex user interface.

2. **Connect your wallet**: Make sure your wallet is connected to the correct network and that you have the necessary funds to pay for transaction fees.

3. **Complete the vault creation form**: Provide the required information, such as the vault's name, symbol, select the asset you wish to use, and use the switch to choose if you want your vault to be **upgradable**.

1. **Select strategies**: Choose the strategies you want to include in your vault. You can select multiple strategies based on your preferences.

> \[!NOTE]\

1. **Submit the transaction**: Once you are sure all the information is correct, sign and submit the transaction to create your vault with your wallet.
2. **Wait for confirmation**: After submitting the transaction, wait for it to be confirmed on the blockchain. Once confirmed, your vault will be active, and you can start interacting with it.
