# Vault

A **DeFindex Vault** is a smart contract that **defines a distribution** of an investment into **one or more strategies**. It works like an index fund or an ETF, where the underlying assets are invested in DeFi protocols. In order to be exposed to DeFi strategies, a user just needs to deposit assets into the Vault. Then, the Vault will take care of automatically investing those assets in the defined strategies.

Once your wallet is connected and you have test tokens, you can create a new vault.

* **Click on “Add Vault”**: This starts the vault creation process.
* **Enter a Name and Symbol (Ticker)**: Choose a name and symbol for your vault. This will help you identify the vault in the future.
