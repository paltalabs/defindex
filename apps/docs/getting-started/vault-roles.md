# Vault Roles

Before deploying a vault, youâ€™ll need to establish the following roles (each tied to an address):

* **Vault Manager**
  * Primary owner of the vault
  * Controls vault settings, role assignments, and upgrades (if enabled)
  * _Recommendation_: Use a multisig wallet
* **Rebalance Manager**
  * Allocates funds across strategies
  * Optimizes distribution for performance
  * _Recommendation_: Implement as an automated bot
* **Fee Receiver**
  * Collects strategy performance fees
  * _Recommendation_: Use a secure, dedicated wallet
* **Emergency Manager**
  * Handles emergency fund recovery
  * Can pause/unwind risky strategies
  * _Recommendation_: Automate for faster response



### Roles

**Roles** are unique identifiers that assign specific responsibilities within the vault and are the only entities with privileges to perform critical actions. Each role is associated with an `Address` that represents the entity responsible for that function.

* **Manager**:
  * Responsible for managing the vault's strategies and operations.
  * Can change the Emergency Manager and Fee Receiver.
  * Can execute all the methods of the other roles.
  * Can upgrade the vault WASM code if the `upgrade` option was enabled on deploy.
* **Emergency Manager**:
  * Responsible for making critical decisions in emergency situations.
  * Can rescue funds in case of an emergency.
  * Can pause or unpause strategies.
* **Rebalance Manager**:
  * Responsible for making adjustments to asset allocation within the vault.
  * Can rebalance between strategies to optimize performance and minimize risk.
* **Fee Receiver**:
  * Receives fees generated by the vault.
  * Can distribute fees from the vault.

> \[!NOTE]\
> In order to reduce risks and ensure the security of the vault, it is recommended to set a multisig address as the `Manager` role. This way, multiple parties must approve critical actions, enhancing security and accountability.
