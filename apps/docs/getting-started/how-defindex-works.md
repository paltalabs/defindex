# How DeFindex Works

### Core Functionality

#### Vault Creation and Integration

* Create custom vaults through our [user-friendly frontend](https://app.defindex.io)
* Seamlessly integrate vaults into your applications using our SDKs
* Connect vaults to multiple DeFi strategies for optimal yield generation

#### Strategy Management

* Dynamically allocate funds across different strategies
* Optimize returns by moving capital between strategies based on performance and risk metrics
* Maintain full control over strategy selection and fund allocation

#### User Operations

* **Deposits**: Funds are automatically deployed to connected strategies (configurable by vault manager)
* **Withdrawals**: Seamless fund retrieval from strategies and vault reserves
* **Emergency Protocol**: Built-in functionality to rescue funds from strategies if needed

#### Revenue Model

* Vault managers decide how much to charge
* Fees are calculated based on the yield generated by underlying strategies
* For example, if fees are 50%, and a user earns 10 USDC on a strategy, 5 USDC will go to the user, 4 USDC will go to the Vault manager and 1 USDC will go to DeFindex.

### Key Benefits

* Immediate yield generation upon deposit
* Flexible strategy management
* Professional-grade security features
* Customizable fee
* Emergency fund protection mechanisms

This architecture allows users to maximize their DeFi yields while maintaining control over their investment strategy and risk exposure.
