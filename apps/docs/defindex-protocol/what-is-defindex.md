**DeFindex** is a decentralized yield protocol designed to make DeFi simple.
It enables **wallet providers** to launch **yield-generating accounts** for their users—fast, secure, and without needing deep DeFi expertise. By connecting to a broad range of decentralized strategies, DeFindex makes it effortless to earn **passive income on crypto assets**.

### ⚙️ How DeFindex Works

- **Tokenized Vaults** → Users interact through DeFindex Vault contracts that gives them access to multiple DeFi opportunities.
- **Diverse Strategies** → Vaults can support one or more assets, and each asset can be allocated across multiple strategies—lending, liquidity pools, tokenized bonds, and more. Anyone can design strategies that plug into the DeFindex ecosystem.
- **Secure Management** → Vault managers can rebalance funds across strategies in a safe and descentralied way, always chasing the best available yield.
- **Optimized Returns** → Earnings are auto-compounded to maximize long-term returns, while **vault managers set fees** to monetize on top of user earnings.

- **Dedicated User Vaults** → Launch a vault for your users, decide which assets and strategies to support, and manage fees.
- **Plug-and-Play Yield Accounts** → Offer savings and investment products directly inside your wallet.
- **Composable Portfolios** → Mix assets and strategies to tailor experiences and manage risk.
- **Developer-Friendly Tools** → APIs and SDKs make it easy to integrate yield with just a few lines of code.
- **Aligned Monetization** → Wallets earn a share of the yield whenever their users earn.

### 🛠️ Solutions for DeFi Developers

- **Open Strategy Framework** → Build, test, and deploy strategies directly into the DeFindex ecosystem.
