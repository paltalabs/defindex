# What is DeFindex?

**DeFindex** is a decentralized yield protocol designed to make DeFi simple.
It enables **wallet providers** to launch **yield-generating accounts** for their users—fast, secure, and without needing deep DeFi expertise. By connecting to a broad range of decentralized strategies, DeFindex makes it effortless to earn **passive income on crypto assets**.

### ⚙️ How DeFindex Works

- **Tokenized Vaults** → Users interact through DeFindex Vault contracts that gives them access to multiple DeFi opportunities.
- **Diverse Strategies** → Vaults can support one or more assets, and each asset can be allocated across multiple strategies—lending, liquidity pools, tokenized bonds, and more. Anyone can design strategies that plug into the DeFindex ecosystem.
- **Secure Management** → Vault managers can rebalance funds across strategies in a safe and descentralied way, always chasing the best available yield.
- **Optimized Returns** → Earnings are auto-compounded to maximize long-term returns, while **vault managers set fees** to monetize on top of user earnings.

#### Vault Creation and Integration

* Create custom vaults through our [user-friendly frontend](https://app.defindex.io)
* Seamlessly integrate vaults into your applications using our SDKs
* Connect vaults to multiple DeFi strategies for optimal yield generation

#### User Operations

* **Deposits**: Funds are automatically deployed to connected strategies (configurable by vault manager)
* **Withdrawals**: Seamless fund retrieval from strategies and vault reserves
* **Emergency Protocol**: Built-in functionality to rescue funds from strategies if needed

#### Revenue Model

* Vault managers decide how much to charge
* Fees are calculated based on the yield generated by underlying strategies
* For example, if fees are 50%, and a user earns 10 USDC on a strategy, 5 USDC will go to the user, 4 USDC will go to the Vault manager and 1 USDC will go to DeFindex.

### Key Benefits

* Immediate yield generation upon deposit
* Flexible strategy management
* Professional-grade security features
* Customizable fee
* Emergency fund protection mechanisms

This architecture allows users to maximize their DeFi yields while maintaining control over their investment strategy and risk exposure.
