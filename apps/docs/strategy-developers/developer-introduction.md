# Developer Introduction

Welcome to the DeFindex Strategy Development Guide! This guide will help you understand how to create a strategy that uses your protocol.

## What is a DeFindex Strategy?

A DeFindex Strategy is a smart contract that implements a specific investment logic for a DeFi protocol. It allows users to automate complex DeFi operations and optimize their yield through a single interface.

It only needs to comply with the strategy interface, which can be found in [github](../../contracts/strategies/core/src/lib.rs). Once it complies with this interface, it can be used by vaults.
