# Create a Vault

DeFindex Vaults let **wallet builders** design yield products tailored to their users.\
With a vault, you choose the **assets**, **strategies**, **allocation**, and **fees**â€”and you can rebalance positions or rescue funds at any time. From the end-userâ€™s perspective, itâ€™s just **deposit and withdraw**.

***

### Step 1: Assign Vault Roles, Fees, and Upgradability

Before deployment, you must configure the following **roles** (each tied to an address):

* **Vault Manager** â€“ primary owner, manages settings, upgrades, and other roles (_use a multisig for security_)
* **Rebalance Manager** â€“ allocates funds across strategies (_can be automated, or managed by a third party_)
* **Fee Receiver** â€“ collects performance fees (_use a secure, dedicated wallet_)
* **Emergency Manager** â€“ rescues funds and pauses risky strategies (_automate for faster response_)

***

**Fees**

* Fees are expressed in **basis points** (1 bp = 0.01%).
* The **Vault Fee** is applied to strategy earnings and assigned to the Fee Receiver.

***

**Upgradability**

* You may choose whether the vault contract is **upgradable**.
* If enabled, the contractâ€™s WASM code can be updated **without user signatures**.
* This allows improvements or bug fixes without interrupting vault operations.

***

### Step 2: Select Assets and Strategies

DeFindex offers **curated and audited strategies**, currently live for:

* **Blend Autocompound â€“ Fixed Pool**: USDC, EURC, XLM
* **Blend Autocompound â€“ YieldBlox Pool**: USDC, EURC, XLM, CETES, USTRY, AQUA
* **Blend Autocompound â€“ Orbit Pool**: XLM, CETES, USTRY, oUSD

### Step 3: Deploy the Vault

You can deploy your Vault in two ways:

* [**Using GUI (Basic)**](using-gui-basic.md)
* [Using the Factory Contract (Advanced)](using-the-factory-advanced.md)

### Step 4: Do a First Deposit&#x20;

A **minimum first deposit of 1001 units** of your supported asset is required.

* **Why?**
  * **1001 units** will be permanently locked in the Vault for security.
* **Example:**\
  If you are depositing **USDC**, this equals just **0.0001001 USDC** â€” practically nothing!

This is because these vaults are protected from something called "inflation attacks" you can read more about this kind of attacks on [OpenZeppelin blog](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/a-novel-defense-against-erc4626-inflation-attacks)

### Step 5: First Rebalance

After deployment, perform the **first rebalance** to define allocations across chosen strategies. This may be a bit confusing right? but How the vault is going to know how to distribute the funds across the different strategies? This step only need to be done once.&#x20;

You have 3 ways to make the first rebalance: using API, using a script  ([discussed here](../smart-contracts/#using-the-example-script-vault_usage_example.ts)) or using [stellar-cli](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/cli)

#### Using API

Make sure you have an `API_KEY` to call the API. And then, call the rebalance function

```
curl --location 'https://api.defindex.io//vault/${VAULT_ADDRESS}/rebalance?network=mainnet' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}' \
--data '{
    "caller": "${MANAGER_OR_REBALANCE_MANAGER}$",
    "instructions": [
        {
            "type": "Invest",
            "strategy_address": "${STRATEGY_ADDRESS}$",
            "amount": 1000000
        }
    ]
}'

```

Where `VAULT_ADDRESS` is the address of the recently deployed vault, `JWT_TOKEN` is the API key, the `MANAGER_OR_REBALANCE_MANAGER` is what you defined when creating the vault. The strategy address is the one you want to invest on. For a list of all the addresses you can check -> [here](../../../../public/mainnet.contracts.json).

This will return you an unsigned XDR, that can be signed using your preferred method of signing. One simple method could be using [Stellar Laboratory](https://lab.stellar.org/transaction/sign). Simply copy and paste the unsigned XDR and sign it.

#### Using stellar-cli

First, you need to setup your keys, make sure the rebalancer manager role defined previously is the one you are going to setup. For example, you can set it up using secret key by:

```bash
stellar keys add --secret-key rebalancer
```

then, you will be prompted to write your secret key.

Next, let's make the rebalance using testnet as example. You can do that by:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org/ \
  --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Network ; September 2015' \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source-account rebalancer \
  -- \
  rebalance \
  --caller <REBALANCER_ADDRESS> \
  --instructions '[{"Invest":["<STRATEGY_ADDRESS>", "<AMOUNT_IN_STROOPS>"]}]'
```

you can find the strategy addresses on [`~/public/<network>.contracts.json`](../../../../public/mainnet.contracts.json).

And that's all!
