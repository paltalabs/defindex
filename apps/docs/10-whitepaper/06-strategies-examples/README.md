Manager Example: Beans App Team Manager decides to diversify investment in Fixed USDC/XLM (Strategy B) and YieldBox USDC/XLM/EUR/AQUA (Strategy C) Because the best yield comes from Strategy B, the initial ratio will be 1:0

If in the future, YieldBox USDC Supply APY is better than the Strategy A USDC supply apy, the Manager can decide to change the ratio to be 0:1
