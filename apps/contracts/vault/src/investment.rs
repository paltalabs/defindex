/// Executes investment allocations for a set of assets based on the provided investment strategies.
///
/// This function ensures that the specified assets and strategies match the contract's known configuration,
/// then validates and processes the investment allocations for each asset and its strategies. It assumes
/// that the caller is responsible for ensuring the correctness of investment ratios and does not check the
/// current state of the strategies or existing investments.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `e` - The current environment reference.
/// * `assets` - A vector of `AssetStrategySet` representing the assets and their associated strategies
///   managed by this vault.
/// * `asset_investments` - A vector of optional investment allocations for each asset.
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<(), ContractError>` - Returns `Ok(())` if all investments are successful, or an appropriate
///   `ContractError` if validation or execution fails.
///
/// # Function Details
/// 1. **Iterates Over Asset Investments**: Loops through each asset's investment allocation, processing only
///    defined allocations.
/// 2. **Validation**:
///    - Confirms that the asset's address matches the expected address in the allocation.
///    - Checks that the number of strategies in the asset matches the provided allocation.
/// 3. **Processes Strategy Investments**:
///    - Ensures that investment amounts are non-negative.
///    - Verifies that strategies are active before investing.
///    - Executes the investment for valid allocations by calling `invest_in_strategy`.
///
/// # Errors
/// * `ContractError::WrongAssetAddress` - If the asset's address does not match the allocation.
/// * `ContractError::WrongStrategiesLength` - If the number of strategies in the asset and allocation do not match.
/// * `ContractError::StrategyPaused` - If an allocation targets a paused strategy.
///
/// # Notes
/// - The function relies on the assets being ordered consistently with the investment allocations.
/// - It allows the caller to update investment ratios freely, without verifying the current state of investments
///   or strategies.

/// Generates investment allocations for a set of assets and their associated strategies.

/// This function calculates the distribution of funds across strategies for each asset based
/// on the current state of strategy investments. The allocations are returned as a vector,
/// where each entry corresponds to an asset's investment allocation or `None` if no allocation
/// is required.
///
/// # Arguments
/// - `e` - Reference to the current environment.
/// - `assets` - A vector of `AssetStrategySet` objects representing the assets and their strategies.
/// - `total_managed_funds` - A map containing the current allocation of funds across all strategies for each asset.
/// - `amounts` - A vector of amounts representing the funds to be allocated for each asset.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Ok(Vec<Option<AssetInvestmentAllocation>>)` - A vector of investment allocations where each entry
///   represents an asset's strategy allocations. If an asset does not require allocation, its entry is `None`.
/// - `Err(ContractError)` - If any errors occur during the allocation process, such as invalid data or calculations.
///
/// # Function Flow
/// 1. **Iterate Over Assets**: For each asset in the provided list:
///    - Skip assets with zero amounts or no prior investments.
///    - Calculate the allocation of funds across strategies proportionally based on the current state.
/// 2. **Proportional Distribution**:
///    - For each strategy within an asset, determine the proportional investment based on its existing allocation.
///    - Ensure that all amounts are correctly calculated without overflows or division errors.
/// 3. **Prepare Allocation**:
///    - Append the calculated strategy allocations to the resulting vector.
///    - Include `None` for assets with no required allocations.
/// 4. **Return Results**: Return the vector containing the investment allocations.
///
/// # Notes
/// - This function does not execute the investments; it only prepares the allocations.
/// - It assumes that the provided `total_managed_funds` contains valid and complete data.
