/// Checks and executes the investments for each asset based on provided allocations.
/// The function iterates through the specified assets and asset investments to ensure validity 
/// and executes investments accordingly.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `e` - The current environment reference.
/// * `assets` - A vector of `AssetStrategySet` that holds information about assets and their associated strategies.
/// * `asset_investments` - A vector of optional investment allocations for each asset.
///s
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<(), ContractError>` - Returns `Ok(())` if all investments are successful or an appropriate `ContractError` if any issue is encountered.
///
/// # Function Flow
/// 1. **Iterate Over Asset Investments**: Loops through each asset investment allocation.
/// 2. **Validation**:
///    - **Asset Address Check**: Ensures that the asset's address matches the expected address in the allocation.
///    - **Strategy Length Check**: Verifies that the number of strategies matches between the asset and the corresponding allocation.
///    - **Note**: The total intended investment check has been removed as the subsequent operations inherently perform the same validation.
/// 3. **Process Strategy Investments**:
///    - For each strategy within an asset:
///      - **Non-Negative Amount Check**: Validates that the investment amount is non-negative.
///      - **Strategy Active Check**: Ensures that the strategy is not paused before proceeding with the investment.
///      - **Execute Investment**: Calls the `invest_in_strategy` fuction if all checks pass.
///
/// # Errors
/// * Returns `ContractError::WrongAssetAddress` if an asset's address does not match the expected address.
/// * Returns `ContractError::WrongStrategiesLength` if the number of strategies in the asset and allocation do not match.
/// * Returns `ContractError::StrategyPaused` if an investment targets a paused strategy.
