We needed rebalancing portfolios to manage multiple DeFi protocols to monetize. That's why we work with DeFindex.\"\n>\n> **Wouter Lugard**, CEO at Beans\n\n## Challenge\n\n### Beans needed competitive stablecoin yields without the 12-month build\n\nEvery wallet builder eventually faces this decision: offer competitive stablecoin yields to your users, or watch them move to wallets that do.\n\nFor Beans—a wallet focused on international remittances for users without blockchain knowledge—the stakes were especially high. Their users in inflation-prone economies were looking for simple, reliable ways to preserve the value of their savings. But building yield infrastructure in-house meant choosing between two impossible options:\n\n<div className=\"my-6 space-y-4\">\n  <div className=\"border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-6 py-4\">\n    <h4 className=\"font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-lime-200\">Option 1: Build it yourself</h4>\n    <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">12+ months of smart contract development, security audits, protocol integrations, and ongoing rebalancing logic. One engineer. Multiple protocols. Endless edge cases. And every week spent building was a week their users earned nothing while competitors shipped.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-6 py-4\">\n    <h4 className=\"font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-lime-200\">Option 2: Skip the feature</h4>\n    <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">Watch users move to wallets that offer yield.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nNeither option worked. Beans needed a third way: a partner who'd already solved the problem.\n\n> \"Our users don't care about blockchain—they care about saving and sending money safely. We needed yield features that matched that promise without becoming DeFi experts ourselves.\"\n>\n> **Wouter Lugard**, CEO at Beans\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n### DeFindex abstracts the entire yield infrastructure stack\n\nBeans didn't need to become DeFi protocol specialists. They needed working infrastructure that integrated in days, not quarters—a way to offer users competitive returns on their USD balances without leaving the app.\n\nDeFindex delivered exactly that: battle-tested yield infrastructure as a service.\n\n> \"We built DeFindex because we saw wallet teams facing the same impossible choice: spend a year building DeFi infrastructure or skip competitive yield features entirely. Our infrastructure eliminates that tradeoff—wallets get production-ready yield in weeks, not quarters.\"\n>\n> **DeFindex Team**\n\nHere's what DeFindex handled so Beans could focus on their users:\n\n<div className=\"my-8 space-y-6\">\n  <div className=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-900/30 to-transparent p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-400\">\n    <h4 className=\"font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-lime-200\">💰 Safe, stable yield strategies built on USD-based assets</h4>\n    <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">Automated strategies delivering up to 62% APY without liquidation risk, all managed through smart contract vaults.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-900/30 to-transparent p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400\">\n    <h4 className=\"font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-lime-200\">🔒 Zero custodial risk</h4>\n    <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">Smart contract vaults manage funds independently.

They've already solved the hard problems.\"\n>\n> **Wouter Lugard**, CEO at Beans\n\n### Integration: From start to live in three weeks\n\nThe timeline moved fast because DeFindex's infrastructure was production-ready:\n\n<div className=\"my-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-cyan-900/30 to-blue-900/20 p-8 rounded-xl border border-cyan-800/30\">\n  <div className=\"space-y-6\">\n    <div className=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n      <div className=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-lg\">1</div>\n      <div>\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold text-lg mb-1 text-lime-200\">Week 1: API Integration</h4>\n        <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">API integration and initial implementation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n      <div className=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-lg\">2</div>\n      <div>\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold text-lg mb-1 text-lime-200\">Week 2: Battle Testing</h4>\n        <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">Full staging environment testing—\"battle testing with weird numbers and stuff like that,\" as the Beans team described it</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n      <div className=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-lg\">3</div>\n      <div>\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold text-lg mb-1 text-lime-200\">Week 3: Go Live</h4>\n        <p className=\"text-cyan-100\">Co-marketing alignment and live launch</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nFor Beans, this meant their developers stayed focused on user experience while yield optimization happened automatically behind the scenes. Zero months learning Soroban smart contract development. Zero security audits to commission. Zero protocols to vet and monitor manually.\n\n> \"The integration was straightforward because we've built DeFindex specifically for wallet teams who don't want to become DeFi experts. Our SDK and API handle all the complexity—vault management, strategy optimization, protocol rebalancing—so partners like Beans can focus on their users.\"\n>\n> **DeFindex Team**\n\n**Zero operational risk to Beans.**\n\n---\n\n## Results\n\n### $610K in deposits, competitive yields shipped, 11+ dev months saved\n\nWithin three months of launching DeFindex-powered yield features, Beans users had deposited **$610,000 in stablecoins**.\n\nBut the numbers tell only part of the story. In emerging markets where Beans operates, competitive yields aren't a nice-to-have feature. They're essential infrastructure for users navigating currency volatility and seeking alternatives to traditional banking that often fails them.\n\n> \"DeFindex vaults fit our promise to users: tested, reliable infrastructure that helps them grow stablecoin savings inside the Beans wallet. Our users see returns. We see revenue. And we never had to build the underlying complexity.\"\n>\n> **Wouter Lugard**, CEO at Beans\n\nBeyond user deposits, Beans now generates incremental revenue from every user who saves through DeFindex-powered vaults—without building or maintaining the underlying infrastructure. As yield strategies optimize automatically across protocols, Beans benefits from shared economics without ongoing engineering overhead.\n\nThe alternative? Twelve months minimum to build, audit, and launch similar functionality in-house. By the time they'd have shipped, the competitive window would have closed and users would have already moved to wallets offering yield.\n\n> \"You can't compete in emerging markets without competitive stablecoin yields. DeFindex let us ship that feature in weeks instead of quarters.\"\n>\n> **Wouter Lugard**, CEO at Beans\n\n---\n\n## About Beans\n\n<div className=\"my-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900/20 via-blue-900/20 to-indigo-900/20 p-8 rounded-xl border border-cyan-800/30\">\n  <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6\">\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"text-sm text-cyan-400 mb-1\">Industry</div>\n      <div className=\"font-semibold text-cyan-100\">Fintech / Web3 Wallet</div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"text-sm text-cyan-400 mb-1\">Focus</div>\n      <div className=\"font-semibold text-cyan-100\">International remittances</div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"text-sm text-cyan-400 mb-1\">Users</div>\n      <div className=\"font-semibold text-cyan-100\">Emerging markets without blockchain knowledge</div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"text-sm text-cyan-400 mb-1\">Headquarters</div>\n      <div className=\"font-semibold text-cyan-100\">Netherlands</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n<div className=\"my-8 p-8 py-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-cyan-900/40 via-purple-900/30 to-blue-900/40 rounded-2xl text-center backdrop-blur-sm\">\n  <p className=\"inline-block text-cyan-100 text-lg px-4 py-4 font-familjen-grotesk font-bold mb-6\">Ready to offer stablecoin yields without the 12-month build cycle?</p>\n  <a href=\"https://defindex.io/\"\n    className=\"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-3xl px-6 py-4 bg-lime-200 transition-all duration-normal hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg active:scale-95 mb-8\">\n      <span className=\"m-0 p-0 leading-none font-manrope font-extrabold text-sm text-cyan-900\">Learn more about DeFindex</span>\n  </a>\n</div>",
