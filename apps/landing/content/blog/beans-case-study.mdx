De lo que nos entregó myosin, las "quotes" de testimonial no fueron dichas nunca por nadie, y los chicos sospechan que hay varios otros textos como "inventados"

Hi!! Hope you’re doing great.
Here’s the case study — let us know your thoughts so we can send it to the Stellar team. I’ve also added the publishing schedule. If you’re on board, we can get started!

"We needed DeFi strategies without touching users' funds. We needed rebalancing portfolios to manage multiple DeFi protocols to monetize. That's why we work with DeFindex."

**Wouter Lugard**, CEO at Beans

## Challenge

### Beans needed competitive stablecoin yields without the 12-month build

Every wallet builder eventually faces this decision: offer competitive stablecoin yields to your users, or watch them move to wallets that do.

For Beans—a wallet focused on international remittances for users without blockchain knowledge—the stakes were especially high. Their users in inflation-prone economies were looking for simple, reliable ways to preserve the value of their savings. But building yield infrastructure in-house meant choosing between two impossible options:

**Option 1: Build it yourself**

12+ months of smart contract development, security audits, protocol integrations, and ongoing rebalancing logic. One engineer. Multiple protocols. Endless edge cases. And every week spent building was a week their users earned nothing while competitors shipped.

**Option 2: Skip the feature**

Watch users move to wallets that offer yield.

Neither option worked. Beans needed a third way: a partner who'd already solved the problem.

"Our users don't care about blockchain—they care about saving and sending money safely. We needed yield features that matched that promise without becoming DeFi experts ourselves," says **Wouter Lugard, CMO at Beans**.

---

## Solution

### DeFindex abstracts the entire yield infrastructure stack

Beans didn't need to become DeFi protocol specialists. They needed working infrastructure that integrated in days, not quarters—a way to offer users competitive returns on their USD balances without leaving the app.

DeFindex delivered exactly that: battle-tested yield infrastructure as a service.

"We built DeFindex because we saw wallet teams facing the same impossible choice: spend a year building DeFi infrastructure or skip competitive yield features entirely," explains the **DeFindex team**. "Our infrastructure eliminates that tradeoff—wallets get production-ready yield in weeks, not quarters."

Here's what DeFindex handled so Beans could focus on their users:

**Safe, stable yield strategies built on USD-based assets**

Automated strategies delivering up to 62% APY without liquidation risk, all managed through smart contract vaults.

**Zero custodial risk**

Smart contract vaults manage funds independently. Beans never touches user deposits, eliminating custody liability and regulatory complexity.

**Plug-and-play UI/UX components**

Pre-built interface elements that integrate directly into the Beans wallet experience. No months of frontend development required.

**One-week integration timeline**

API and SDK ready to implement versus 12+ months building in-house. From kickoff to staging in two weeks, live in three.

"We needed rebalancing portfolios to manage multiple DeFi protocols to monetize. That's why we work with DeFindex. They've already solved the hard problems," explains **Wouter Lugard, CMO at Beans**.

### Integration: From start to live in three weeks

The timeline moved fast because DeFindex's infrastructure was production-ready:

**Week 1:** API integration and initial implementation

**Week 2:** Full staging environment testing—"battle testing with weird numbers and stuff like that," as the Beans team described it

**Week 3:** Co-marketing alignment and live launch

For Beans, this meant their developers stayed focused on user experience while yield optimization happened automatically behind the scenes. Zero months learning Soroban smart contract development. Zero security audits to commission. Zero protocols to vet and monitor manually.

"The integration was straightforward because we've built DeFindex specifically for wallet teams who don't want to become DeFi experts," notes the **DeFindex team**. "Our SDK and API handle all the complexity—vault management, strategy optimization, protocol rebalancing—so partners like Beans can focus on their users."

Zero operational risk to Beans.

## Results

### $610K in deposits, competitive yields shipped, 11+ dev months saved

Within three months of launching DeFindex-powered yield features, Beans users had deposited **$610,000 in stablecoins**.

## Results

### $610K in deposits, competitive yields shipped, 11+ dev months saved

Within three months of launching DeFindex-powered yield features, Beans users had deposited **$610,000 in stablecoins**.

But the numbers tell only part of the story. In emerging markets where Beans operates, competitive yields aren't a nice-to-have feature. They're essential infrastructure for users navigating currency volatility and seeking alternatives to traditional banking that often fails them.

**$610K**

in stablecoin deposits within 3 months

**1 week**

integration timeline

**11+ months**

of dev time saved

"DeFindex vaults fit our promise to users: tested, reliable infrastructure that helps them grow stablecoin savings inside the Beans wallet. Our users see returns. We see revenue. And we never had to build the underlying complexity," says **Wouter Lugard, CEO at Beans**.

Beyond user deposits, Beans now generates incremental revenue from every user who saves through DeFindex-powered vaults—without building or maintaining the underlying infrastructure. As yield strategies optimize automatically across protocols, Beans benefits from shared economics without ongoing engineering overhead.

The alternative? Twelve months minimum to build, audit, and launch similar functionality in-house. By the time they'd have shipped, the competitive window would have closed and users would have already moved to wallets offering yield.

"You can't compete in emerging markets without competitive stablecoin yields. DeFindex let us ship that feature in weeks instead of quarters," concludes **Wouter Lugard, CEO at Beans**.
