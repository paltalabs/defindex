## Background

Seevcash is a mobile-first fintech platform serving Ghana's underserved markets, where 40% of the population remains unbanked but mobile penetration exceeds 140%. The company's mission centers on payment accessibility - including a unique feature where users watch ads to offset transaction fees, removing barriers where every cedi matters.

Recently awarded Stellar Foundation marketing grants, Seevcash needed competitive yield features to retain users in West Africa's fast-moving fintech landscape. Without them, users would migrate to competitors offering returns that outpace local inflation.

## Challenge

Seevcash's users were clear: they wanted competitive returns on stablecoin holdings. But the technical reality was daunting.

Patrick, Seevcash's lead engineer, described the core problem:

> "Most wallet builders don't know smart contracts. For us, it's very time-consuming to develop something like this. We don't even see the solution until someone shows us it exists."

**The barriers were threefold:**

### Time Anxiety

Building comparable infrastructure in-house would require 12+ months: learning Stellar smart contracts, building vault infrastructure, conducting security audits, and implementing sponsorship flows. For a small team focused on core wallet features, that timeline was impossible.

### Technical Complexity

The team would need to understand underlying DeFi protocols, assess liquidation risks, create rebalancing strategies, and handle ongoing protocol monitoring - expertise far beyond their core competencies.

### User Experience Friction

Users would need to acquire XLM for gas fees - a deal-breaker in markets where even small amounts matter. Without Stellar's sponsorship flow, each transaction would require users to manage blockchain complexity directly.

Dawit, Seevcash's founder, summed it up:

> "Time is the main problem. Even if we had the capability, dedicating that much engineering time means delaying everything else our users need."

## Solution

At Stellar's Meridian Conference in Rio de Janeiro (September 2024), the Seevcash team discovered DeFindex offered battle-tested yield infrastructure they could white-label in days.

### Week 1: API Integration

Patrick's team integrated DeFindex's REST API immediately after returning from Brazil. The API handled complex DeFi interactions behind the scenes - automated deposits into Blend Capital, real-time APY calculations, secure withdrawals, and smart contract risk management.

> "I remember arriving back in Ghana and showing Esteban, 'Hey, we actually have the integration done.' It took us one week."

### Weeks 2-4: SDK Migration

As adoption grew among internal testers, the team migrated to DeFindex's SDK to leverage Stellar's sponsorship flow - eliminating gas fees entirely.

The impact was immediate. "The SDK cut our codebase by more than 50%," Patrick explained. "The workload is handled by DeFindex. We just take advantage of the simplicity."

**What the SDK enabled:**

- Zero gas fees for users through sponsored transactions
- One-tap deposits and withdrawals with complexity abstracted completely
- Dramatically reduced code with fewer potential bugs
- Example repositories that turned multi-day implementations into hours

Patrick was emphatic: "Looking at the current integration we have now, that should be a day's work. It's plug and play."

### 86% Time Reduction

**Traditional approach:** 12+ months estimated

**DeFindex approach:** 1 week initial, 1 day with SDK templates

The difference freed Seevcash's engineering team to focus on features that actually differentiate them in the Ghanaian market.

### 433% TVL Growth in One Week

After six weeks of internal testing, Seevcash activated marketing in early November 2024. The results were immediate.

- **Sept 14 - Nov 1:** Steady $2-3K baseline during internal validation
- **Nov 2-9:** Explosive growth to $13K peak (433% increase)
- **24 active users** earning yield across income levels
- **No minimum investment** required - true accessibility

### The Trust-Building Moment

The numbers tell only part of the story. In emerging markets, trust matters more than APY.

> "I've had every single person who deposited ask me, 'Is it real?' When they see the money adding up after just five minutes, they always ask. I tell them, 'Yeah, you can withdraw it as well.' That builds trust immediately." — Dawit, Founder

The ability to deposit small amounts, see real-time earnings, and withdraw instantly transformed skepticism into confidence.

### Internal Adoption First

Before external marketing launched, Seevcash had their own validation metric.

> "For me, the metric to know we're building something very good is when my co-founders and engineers begin using it just like me. When I realized Patrick is now keeping his money in his wallet, I knew other people would use it too." — Dawit, Founder

The signal proved accurate. Seevcash's CTO now holds over $4,000 in the platform - significant savings in the Ghanaian context.

### White-Label Validation in 6 Weeks

Within six weeks of launching yield features, a financial services partner in Ghana approached Seevcash wanting to white-label the same integration.

> "We already have a client who wants this integration through their platform, then to DeFindex. We've already started onboarding third parties." — Patrick, Lead Engineer

This unsolicited B2B expansion proved three critical points: the integration is genuinely simple enough to resell, market demand is strong enough that competitors see the feature as necessary, and DeFindex's infrastructure model works at scale.

### 50% Code Reduction

The SDK migration delivered unexpected engineering benefits beyond speed.

> "We're less likely to create bugs now because the codebase is so much smaller and cleaner. The SDK made things much more streamlined." — Patrick, Lead Engineer

For a small team where every engineering hour counts, cleaner code means faster feature velocity and fewer production incidents that erode user trust.

## What DeFindex Actually Handles

To understand the value proposition, consider what Seevcash avoided building:

**Smart Contract Infrastructure:** Vault management, strategy logic, emergency rescue functionality, role-based access controls

**Protocol Integration:** Connecting to yield sources, monitoring protocol health, handling upgrades, rebalancing when yields shift

**User Experience:** Stellar sponsorship for gasless transactions, real-time APY calculations, transaction history, secure withdrawals

**Ongoing Maintenance:** Security monitoring, protocol evaluation, SDK updates, documentation

DeFindex handles all of this, letting Seevcash focus on accessible financial experiences for Ghanaian users.

## The Bottom Line

Seevcash transformed a 12+ month infrastructure project into a one-week integration, achieved 433% TVL growth in one week following marketing activation, and signed their first white-label partner within six weeks.

The difference? Recognizing that yield infrastructure should be a commodity, not a competitive advantage.

> "I think what makes our partnership work isn't just the product or the yield. It's that Esteban and Francisco can be trusted. Business is built on trust. Everything else is a bonus." — Dawit, Founder
