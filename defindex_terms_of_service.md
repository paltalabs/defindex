# DeFindex Terms of Service

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to DeFindex, a decentralized platform providing tools for creating and managing smart contract–based vaults ("the Service"). By using DeFindex, you ("User," "You," or "Your") agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and DeFindex. Please read them carefully.

## 2. Services Provided
DeFindex is a set of open-source smart contracts, SDKs, and related infrastructure that enable developers and wallet providers to **create and manage vaults** on the Stellar network.

The Service includes, but is not limited to:
- Smart contracts and tools to deploy vaults.
- SDKs and APIs to interact with deployed vaults.
- Developer documentation, interfaces, and support services.

**Important:** DeFindex does **not** allow Users to deposit, invest, or otherwise manage funds directly through its platform. DeFindex provides infrastructure only; all usage depends on third-party integrations and the Stellar network.

## 3. Eligibility
By accessing and using DeFindex, you confirm that:
- You are at least 18 years old or the legal age in your jurisdiction.
- You are not located in, or a resident of, a jurisdiction where the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure is restricted or prohibited.
- You have the technical ability and understanding required to interact with blockchain-based applications.

## 4. User Responsibility and Security
- **Wallet & Keys:** You are solely responsible for managing your private keys, wallet access, and any associated credentials. DeFindex does not store or recover private keys.
- **Transactions:** You are responsible for reviewing and approving any blockchain transaction before submitting it. Transactions are irreversible once confirmed on the Stellar network.
- **Compliance:** You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, and tax obligations applicable to you.

## 5. Risk Acknowledgment
By using DeFindex, you acknowledge and agree that:
- Blockchain networks, including Stellar, are experimental and subject to high risks, technical failures, and vulnerabilities.
- Vaults created with DeFindex are autonomous smart contracts. DeFindex does not guarantee their security, performance, or fitness for any particular purpose.
- DeFindex does not endorse or audit third-party vaults created using its tools. Any vaults deployed by others are independent and outside the control of DeFindex.
- You may lose access to assets if smart contracts, the Stellar network, or your wallet malfunction.

## 6. No Custodial Services & No Investment Advice
- DeFindex is **non-custodial**: it never holds or manages user funds.
- DeFindex does not provide financial, investment, or legal advice. Nothing on the platform constitutes a recommendation to invest or engage in any financial activity.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- DeFindex is not liable for any loss, damage, or liability arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to smart contract failures, technical errors, or network outages.
- DeFindex makes no warranties regarding availability, reliability, or suitability of the Service.
- You assume full responsibility for your use of the Service and the risks associated with blockchain technology.

## 8. Open Source & Disclaimer of Warranty
DeFindex software is made available under an open-source license. It is provided **“AS IS” and without warranties or conditions of any kind**, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

## 9. Changes to Terms
DeFindex reserves the right to modify or update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
